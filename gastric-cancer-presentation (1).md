## Slide 1: Title
- **Title**: Clinical Pathological and Immunohistochemical Correlations in Gastric Cancer
- **Authors**: Mihaela Andronic, Dragos-Viorel Scripcariu, Mădălina Maria Palaghia, et al.
- **Source**: Diagnostics 2024, 14, 1367

## Slide 2: Introduction
- Gastric cancer: 3rd leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide
- High regional heterogeneity in incidence and survival rates
  - Europe: 20% 5-year survival (diagnosed in advanced stages)
  - Some Asian countries: up to 60% 5-year survival
- Eastern Europe has one of the highest incidence rates

## Slide 3: Study Focus
- **Purpose**: Analyze expression of Her2 and Ki67
- **Aim**: Identify correlations with clinical and pathological characteristics
- **Goal**: Evaluate potential as prognostic factors

## Slide 4: Background on Biomarkers
- **Her2**: Transmembrane glycoprotein (EGFR family member)
  - Trastuzumab: First targeted therapy for Her2+ gastric cancer
  - Remains unclear as a prognostic marker
- **Ki67**: Tumor proliferation marker
  - Role in gastric cancer remains controversial

## Slide 5: Materials & Methods
- Retrospective study (2018-2022)
- 48 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer
- All underwent open radical or partial D2 gastrectomy
- All cases were adenocarcinomas
- Her2 and Ki67 testing performed
- Lauren classification used (intestinal, diffuse, mixed types)

## Slide 6: Patient Demographics
- 34 male (70%) / 14 female (30%)
- Mean age: 67 years
- Tumor location:
  - Medium stomach (body/fundus): 52%
  - Proximal (cardia): 18%
  - Distal (antrum): 32%
- 77% were well/moderately differentiated

## Slide 17: Discussion - Her2
- Her2 positivity (31.25%) above average compared to European studies (10-22.8%)
- Strong association with Lauren's intestinal subtype
- Important prognostic factor due to correlation with:
  - Perineural invasion
  - Lymph node involvement
- Direct implications for trastuzumab therapy

## Slide 18: Discussion - Ki67
- High percentage of Ki67+ cases (83.33%)
- Statistically significant relation with grade of gastric carcinoma
- Not confirmed as an independent prognostic factor
- Inconsistent with some studies, consistent with others
- Heterogeneous findings across geographical regions

## Slide 19: Limitations & Future Research
- Relatively limited sample size
- Need for prospective studies with larger sample sizes
- Need for appropriate scoring system for Her2 and Ki67
- Potential for additional biomarkers to enhance prognostic value

## Slide 20: Conclusions
- Her2 and Ki67 show positive but limited clinicopathologic value
- Her2 has stronger prognostic significance than Ki67
- Important heterogeneity in literature data remains
- Results contribute to the "diagnostic puzzle" of gastric cancer
- Further research needed for validation and standardization
